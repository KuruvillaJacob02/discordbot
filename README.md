# Humpty Sharma (A python Discord Bot)
Hi I'm Humpty Sharma! I'm a a multipurpose discord bot and I can perform various functions such as Playing music, moderation etc! My creator is working on adding new features
daily! If you're wondering  my name is modelled after the character of the same name from the bollywoood movie humppty sharma ki dulhania.

# How to run it
- If you wish to host the bot yourself, install the required depedencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
##### (you could additonally  list out the dependencies in the readme itself.)

- Create a file name ```.env``` in the root folder and mention your bot token in it.
- Run the bot with python bot.py.

##### If you want to add more cogs, add them to /cogs/ and don't forget to load it in bot.py.
